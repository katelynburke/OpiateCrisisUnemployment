By Rishi Hebbar, Katelyn Burke, Xuan He, and Ashraf Al Mamun

### Background Information

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, more than 130 people in the United States die each day from an opiod overdose. The opiod crisis has become more severe in the U.S. year after year. The midwestern region saw opioid overdoses increase 70 percent from July 2016 through September 2017. The opioid crisis has an economic burden of approximately $78.5 billion per year in the U.S. This includes the costs of healthcare, loss of productivity, treatment, criminal justice.

We chose to research the trends between opioid overdose deaths and the unemployment rate in the United States. We created a dashboard that displays interactive visualizations comparing tthe overdose rate and unemployment rate by state. 

### Data Sources
